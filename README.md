# REKOD Panel
A simple web panel for your Docker containers.

## Setup
To start you need to have both Docker and Node installed.

Clone the repo and nagviate from the root directory to both the client and api folders. In both run `npm install` & `npx tsc` to compile all the ts files, from there run `npm start` to download the dependencies and start the client & api.

The client should now be accessible from http://localhost:3000.

The api runs on port 8080 by default.
