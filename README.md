# Docker Panel
A simple web panel that allows you to run Docker containers.

## Setup
To start you need to have both Docker and Node installed. When using Docker you can either pull the image or build it locally.

If not using Docker, clone the repo and nagviate from the root directory to both the client and api folders. In both run `npm install` & `npm start` to download the dependencies and start the web server & api.

The web server should now be accessible from http://localhost:3000

The api runs on http://localhost:8080 but can be changed in the .env file
