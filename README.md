# REKOD Panel
A simple web panel for your Docker containers.

## Setup
To start you need to have both Docker and Node installed (be sure the Docker Engine is running too!).

Clone the repo and nagviate from the root directory to both the client and api folders. In both run `npm install` for dependencies and `npm start` to start the client & api.

The client should now be accessible from http://localhost:3000.

The api runs on port 8080 by default.

### Future Plans
- [ ] Create user system
- [ ] More container options
- [ ] Create Docker config
- [ ] Log all container proccesses
