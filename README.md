# REKOD Panel
A simple web panel for your Docker containers.

## Setup
To start you need to have both Docker and Node installed. When using Docker you can either pull the image or build it locally.

If not using Docker, clone the repo and nagviate from the root directory to both the client and api folders. In both run `npm install` & `npm start` to download the dependencies and start the client & api.

The client should now be accessible from http://localhost:3000.

The api runs on port 8080 by default.
